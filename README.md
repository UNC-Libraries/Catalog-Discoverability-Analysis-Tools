This suite of scripts gathers data on the discoverability (via our main online catalog) of individual titles within e-collections. It also gathers data on bibliographic richness/quality (counts of subject headings, classification numbers, author headings, etc. in records). 

The scripts output data on individual titles (i.e. bibliographic records) in a given collection. Script output is ingested into a database that compiles collection-level reports.
